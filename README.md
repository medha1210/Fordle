# Fordle

Do you also feel like playing wordle with friends so they can suggest you words and play together? Fordle (Friends Wordle!) aims to do exactly that!!

This project focuses on:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze Wordle game data to understand word difficulty, guessing patterns, and player performance.
- **Machine Learning:** Build a model to **recommend words** during gameplay based on historical data.
- **Visualization & Deployment:** Use **Streamlit** for an interactive interface, **Power BI** for dashboards, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for deployment.
